Tools: 
- Some test lists
- Code unit tests
- Some manual testing




Timing:
Requirements 2, 3 & 16 can be tested after FileIO reading/writing, Controller reading/writing, Patron, Media, and minimal UI are done. It isn't affected much by the presence or absence of other requirements.

Requirements 4, 5, 6, & 17 can be tested after the UI and Controller support checkin/out.

Requirements 7 & 8 can be tested as soon as Media, Patron, and minimal UI and Controller support is ready.

Requirements 9, 10, 11 need support from the Database, UI, and Controller.

Requirement 12 can be tested as time-sensitive features are implemented.

Requirements 13 & 18 can be tested as the UI is developed.

Requirements 14 and 15 will probably get most of their testing after the Database object is completed.
